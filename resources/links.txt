Machine learning pipeline

Find data

Clean data 

Choose and tune your algorithm

Visualize results

Google and stack overflow




Six months?

Learn the math (2 - 3 months)

Learn the programming language (1 month)

Machine learning tutorials and test projects (1 - 2 months)

Short term passion projects (1+ month)



You are going to fail a lot. It's software.. so who cares?

Your models may not be predictive.
That's a result. Null is just as good as non-null if you did it right.

Learn GitHub and write up your results.

Clustering 
Without labeled data



Machine learning is everywhere


Almost every computer program learns something


1959 

All useful programs "learn something"

Linear regression
Computer code to fit the data point
Computer starts to learn and predict behavior
Program that can learn from experience

Early definition of machine learning:

Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Arthur Samuel 1959

Computer pioneer who wrote first self-learning program that plays checkers
Invented alpha-beta pruning, widely used in decision tree algorithms




Why machine learning?

Where is machine learning used?

Where is machine learning going?



Machine learning is using data to answer questions


Training
Using data


Prediction
Answer questions


Data -> training -> model -> serve predictions -> answer questions
